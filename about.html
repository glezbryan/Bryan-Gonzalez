                        Greetings! I'm Bryan Gonzalez, a passionate computer engineering enthusiast navigating the fascinating realm of circuits and beyond at the University of Texas at Arlington. My educational journey commenced in the halls of Kennedale High School, where I not only mastered Java but also achieved a notable 4 on the AP exam—a testament to my early passion for coding and technology.<br><br>
                        Venturing into the captivating world of web development, I find joy in crafting digital wonders with proficiency in languages like C, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. However, my exploration doesn't stop at the digital frontier—I've recently delved into the intricate world of circuits and electronics.<br><br>
                        My current obsession involves tinkering with the versatile Raspberry Pi, where I channel my creativity into crafting innovative projects. From Game Boy restoration to designing accessories that breathe new life into classic devices, I relish the challenge of merging technology and nostalgia.<br><br>
                        But my journey goes beyond restoration—I thrive on the thrill of reverse engineering. Diving into the heart of electronics, I dissect and understand their inner workings, unraveling the mysteries of technology one component at a time. It's a pursuit that fuels my curiosity and deepens my appreciation for the intricacies of the devices that surround us.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        Outside the digital realm, my heart finds fulfillment in personal connections. In 2022, I took a monumental step into the world of marriage, embracing the journey alongside a special someone. Together, we've built a cozy haven filled with love, laughter, and the pitter-patter of eight furry feet – courtesy of our two adorable dogs.<br><br>
                        While my color guard days as a performer with the Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps may be in the past, the lessons learned continue to resonate. The discipline, teamwork, and pursuit of perfection cultivated during those years shape my approach to every endeavor.<br><br>
                        In the midst of academic pursuits, web development, marriage, and the exploration of circuits, I am steadfast in my commitment to living life to the fullest. Every line of code, each project with the Raspberry Pi, the joy of reverse engineering, and the shared moments with loved ones contribute to the vibrant tapestry of my multifaceted life.

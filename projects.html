                <p>
                    A while ago I found a Game Boy Advance (GBA) in a poor condition. I grew up loving the GBA so 
                    I figured it would be fun side project to repair and refurbish it.
                </p><hr>
                Initial GBA damage:
                <p style="margin: 0px 40px;">
                    - Will not stay on for longer than a second. <br>
                    - Screen would not turn on. <br>
                    - heavy damage to shell <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="project-image-container">

                </div><hr>
                <p>
                    Ordered a new battery and shell. <br>
                    GBA will now stay on but still no display
                </p><hr>
                <p>
                    I took the GBA out of it's shell. <br>
                    The ribbon cable that connects to the screen was loose so reattaching it fixed the issue. All that left is to put the GBA into it's new shell.

                    <b><b>Description</b></b>
                    For my Object-Oriented Programming final project, I created an engaging and interactive game inspired by Wordle, incorporating different difficulty levels to enhance the player experience. The project was undertaken with minimal instructions, providing the freedom to explore creative solutions and apply various programming concepts.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Key Features </b>
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0px 40px;">
                    <b>1. Gameplay Mechanics </b><br>
                    - The game is structured with three difficulty levels â€“ Easy, Medium, and Hard.<br>
                    - Each difficulty level corresponds to a specific word length (5, 6, and 7 letters, respectively).<br>
                    - Players are given a set number of guesses based on the difficulty level, adding a strategic element to the gameplay.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) </b><br>
                    - The project utilizes the Swing library to create a user-friendly GUI.<br>
                    - The GUI enhances the gaming experience by providing a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>3. File Handling </b><br>
                    - A key aspect of the project involved working with text files to read word libraries for each difficulty level.<br>
                    - This allowed for a dynamic and easily updatable system for word choices, adding an element of variety to the gameplay.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>4. JPanel with Card Layout </b><br>
                    - One of the standout features of the project is the implementation of a JPanel with a Card Layout.<br>
                    - This layout efficiently manages multiple panels, facilitating seamless transitions between different menus within the game.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Challenges and Learnings </b><br>
                    While the project was a success overall, it was not without its challenges. The choice of word libraries posed a significant challenge, with the 6-letter word list being too extensive and including obscure words, while the 7-letter word list was too limited, resulting in some common words being excluded.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Conclusion </b><br>
                    The Wordle Challenge Game is a testament to the creativity and problem-solving skills applied in an object-oriented programming context. The use of GUI, file handling, and innovative layout management contribute to a polished and enjoyable gaming experience. The project showcases the ability to overcome challenges and highlights areas for potential improvements in future iterations.

                    <b>Description</b><br>
                    In the realm of terminal-based programming using C and compiled with gcc, I embarked on a project inspired by my studies in music theory, specifically post-tonal theory. As a music major delving into the intricacies of matrices in the context of post-tonal music, I developed a simple yet informative program.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Key Features</b>
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0px 40px;">
                    <b>1. Matrix Representation</b><br>
                       - The program focuses on matrices used in post-tonal music theory.<br>
                       - It takes the first row of a matrix as input and generates and prints the full matrix, providing a visual representation for further analysis.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>2. Terminal-Based Interface</b><br>
                       - The program operates within the terminal environment, providing a lightweight and accessible interface for users.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>3. Educational Context</b><br>
                       - Developed during my studies in music theory, the project serves as a practical application of matrix concepts within the realm of post-tonal music.<br>
                       - It is designed to aid music enthusiasts, students, and educators in visualizing and understanding the matrix structures frequently encountered in post-tonal compositions.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Compilation and Execution</b><br>
                       - The program is written in C and can be compiled using gcc, making it compatible with various systems.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Link to Matrices in Post-Tonal Music Wiki</b>
                    For those interested in delving deeper into the connection between matrices and post-tonal music, refer to the [Matrices in Post-Tonal Music Wiki](insert_link_here), offering a comprehensive resource on the theoretical aspects and applications.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Conclusion</b><br>
                    The Matrix Explorer for Post-Tonal Music is a niche yet valuable tool that bridges the gap between music theory and programming. By providing a clear representation of matrices in the context of post-tonal compositions, the program serves as an educational resource for music enthusiasts exploring the intersection of music theory and computer science.</p>
